Imagine you're managing a small tech company with 8 employees. At the end of the year, you piece together some data about 
your employees, with the intention of understanding better the state of your company. The data you collected is 
straightforward, and you can quickly make a few conclusions just by using a bit of arithmetics and logic.

But years have gone by, and your business has grown into a successful company with 231 employees. 
You still want to get insights from data, but now you have so much of it that analyzing it has become 
difficult and inconvenient. As you continue to scale your company, analyzing data slowly gears toward becoming an 
impossible task.

Using statistical techniques, we can organize, summarize, and visualize large amounts of data to find patterns 
that otherwise would remain hidden.
In the case of a sample, you'll often see this terminology used interchangeably: 
sample unit, sample point, sample individual, or sample observation.
